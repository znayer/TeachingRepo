                <h2>Appointments</h2>
                <p>Usually our physicians see patients on an appointment basis. However, when necessary, they will work on a patient. </p>
                <p>If you are experiencing problems, please call our office. We will arrange for you to see your physician as soon as possible. Our office hours are from 8 am to 5 pm, Monday to Friday. To schedule an appointment during your physician's office hours, please call us at 1-855-763-7630. </p>
                <p>If you are unable to keep your appointment, please let us know as soon as possible. Our physicians make every effort to keep their appointments on schedule. Emergencies do arise, however, and sometimes a delay is unavoidable. When this happens, we do all we can to minimize the inconvenience. If an emergency occurs and you need to contact your doctor during office hours, call us. We have physicians on call at all times, and one will be available to help you. </p>
                <h2>Insurance Information</h2>
                <p>We participate in most major health insurance plans. Please check with your insurance provider at the outset of treatment to ensure that you are covered for your treatment (and at what level) and to be sure that we are listed as a provider in your plan. It is the patient's responsibility to check their insurance plan coverage. </p>
                <p class="md-0">To avoid unpleasant and expensive surprises, we strongly encourage our patients to carefully research the specific provisions of their health insurance coverage. Insurers typically deny coverage if you do not meet their provisions. It is the patient's responsibility to know the specific requirements of their coverage, and to inform our office of all special requirements. It is important that you bring your insurance card to every appointment. If you change insurance companies or change your address, phone number, etc., please contact our office as soon as possible so we can make the necessary changes to your file.</p>

                        It is the policy of this office to verify your insurance monthly. Often, insurance plans can make small changes, such as your group number or your co-payment, even though you stay with the same carrier. Your employer may also change plans. In order to most accurately bill insurance on your behalf, we strive to verify this information monthly.
